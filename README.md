# Katanator
Runs this problem every day to practice a kata problem to solve... 

usage: python katanator.py

Example output: Langugage: python, Problem: Implement insert, merge, and quick sort to sort an array of integers.

When you run Katanator one problem is selected from the file problems.json.  
Maintain a list of ~ 10 problems that can be solved in about 30 minutes.  These should be practice problems intended to sharpen your coding skills.

Katanator also outputs a random language from file file languages.json.  
languages.json should include a few languages that you wish to practice.


Tips for good problems:
Problems should be interesting but manageable.  You should be able to solve them without looking up anything on the internet or relying on code completion.  
For me, repition is key.  If I practice an algorithm once, I will likely forget it.  e.g. if I want to sharpen my graph traversal skills,
I will leave a simple problem that requires a breadth first and depth first search in problems.json for months, that way I encounter it many times. 

Tips for solving problems:
As a polyglot programmer, it is easy to forget syntaxi or library usage e.g Ruby's if - elsif vs Python's if - elif.  For me, if I look up syntax on the internet
everytime I get hung up, I never remmember it.  Do don't look anything up and don't rely on code completion.
